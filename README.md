# Hey, I'm Aditya

AI/ML Engineer. Architect. Tinkerer of brains—biological and artificial.

I specialize in building **agentic AI systems** that actually *think*, not just autocomplete. From **CFG-driven LLMs** to **cloud-native MLOps pipelines**, I design AI that’s composable, scalable, and a little dangerous (in a good way).

---

## 🧠 Currently...
- Building multi-agent orchestration engines at **FastpeerAI**
- Designing **LLM pipelines that obey rules**, not vibes
- Co-developing **Large Brain Models** with **Max Hospitals** & **IHBAS**
- Making EEGs do things they were probably never meant to do

---

## 🛠️ Stuff I Build/ Will build in near future

- ⚙️ **HLGuidance** → Grammar-constrained LLM generation  
  → Built with `GuidanceAI`. Structured generation by leveraging `Guidance's` API to the fullest, a no-nonsense AI orchestration framework which gives just enough tooling to build an AI centric software without using 100s of over-engineered abstractions, **coughs** .. langchain .. **coughs**.

- ... When I find the time to properly arrange and publish here.

## 🧪 Things I’ve Done

- Refactored LLM inference with **CFGs** and **regex**, doubling context recall and slashing latency by 90%
- Achieved 82% EEG classification accuracy for **epilepsy detection** in clinical settings
- Created a **neural cellular automata** library 10x faster in JAX—because why not

## 📜 Academic Street Cred

- 🎓 IIT Mandi | Double Major: CS & Bioengineering  
  Neuroscience, deep learning, and other fun stuff.

- 📄 **EEG-Depth-Image** (ICPR Workshop '24)  
  Depth map reconstruction from EEG—don’t ask how, just know it works (cosine sim: 0.81)

- 📄 **Epilepsy Detection, Deconstructed** (Under Review - IEEE Epilepsia)  
  Tore apart the Bonn EEG dataset. Built something better.

## 🧰 My Stack

- **Languages**: Python (can read my mind), Rust (just enough), C/C++ (if I must)  
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch, LangChain, TensorFlow, Guidance, vLLM  
- **Infra**: Kubernetes, Terraform, Argo, GCP, DigitalOcean  
- **Extras**: FastAPI (pro), MNE, YOLOv8, JAX, Pyspark

## 🏆 Highlights

- 🥇 **Amazon ML Challenge** – AIR 18  
  Cracked product categorization with a vision-language pipeline and a 0.71 harmonic F1

- 🧠 **INSERB Youth Conclave** – 2nd Runner-up  
  Invented a cognitive meta-language for aliens. The judges survived.
